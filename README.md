# ThreeBodyProblem
This project investigates the stability of the three body problem with respect to perturbations in initial conditions as part of an end of year project, that was completed at the end of my first year studying mathematics at UCL.

The details, results and conlusions of the study are summarised in the presentaion file, which is also uploaded in this repository.

I would like to stress that we are investigating a very special case of the 3 body problem, where we have 3 point masses evenly spaced out on the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit (see presentation for more details on the choice of units), moving at a speed of 1 tangentially to the circle anticlockwise. In additon, we are also restricting our study to two dimensions. 

There are 3 code files attached.

1. "Symmetric Perturbations" - Compares the trajectories of particles with a symmetric perturbation in angle, mass and speed to the unperturbed system.
. 
2. "Asymmetric Perturbations" - The same as above but for asymmetric perturbations
  
3. Periodic Solutions - A set of initial conditions, that lead to the lemniscate or figure 8 orbit

All code is written in Jupyter Notebook.
